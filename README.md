#Why I chose each loop type for each challenge:
## Challenge 1: Didn't have a clear thought of when the loop ended so used while so it stops when it met the condition needed.
## Challenge 2: If and Else statements, used the for loops since I knew the range of items I wanted.
## Challenge 3: Used for again since I knew the range.

## Challenge 1, how it works:
###The code takes a positive integer from the user and applies a specific set of rules repeatedly until the number reaches 1. It then prints the sequence and the total number of steps taken.

## Challenge 2, how it works: 
###Determines whether a positive integer entered by the user is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


## Challenge 3, how it works: 
###This challenge generates and prints a 10x10 multiplication table using nested loops.
